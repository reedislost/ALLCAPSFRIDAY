ALL CAPS FRIDAY

I’M GOING TO WRITE AND RELEASE A SHORT PIECE OF WRITING I’M GONNA CALL ALL CAPS FRIDAY IN HONOR OF THAT CARRIER THAT SENDS ALL THEIR EMAILS IN CAPS. YEARS AGO I WORKED WITH A SEASONED VETERAN OF TRUCKING AT THIS ATLANTA AREA CARRIER THAT NEVER SENT ME A LOWERCASE LETTER IN AN EMAIL IN LIKE 2 YEARS. LEGENDARY STAMINA THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW WITNESS. 

THE NOTE WILL LIKELY BE STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS STYLE WITH LITTLE REGARD FOR GRAMMAR OR SPELLING I’M WRITING THIS IN MARKDOWN IN VIM SO NO SPELL CHECK SRY 

IM DOING THIS AS A WAY OF FORCING MYSELF TO GET BETTER AT WRITING WHICH I HAVENT DONE FOR MANY YEARS AND TO SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT MY COMPANY LOSTFR8. I HOPE THIS NON TRADITIONAL WRITING STYLE PROVIDES YOU WITH SLIGHT CHUCKEL, BUT ILL TAKE AN EYE ROLL TOO….


ITS GOOD TO BE SPONTANEOUS ABOUT THINGS CUZ NOWADAYS SPONTANAEITY (I THINK I SPELLED THAT WRONG) ARE SEVERELY UNDERRATED. 

WELCOME TO ALL CAPS FRIDAY
